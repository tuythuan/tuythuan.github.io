Mashu calls Guda a Cripro, short for christmas professional
and ask him what does he thinks
Karna says he understand, and explain that he feels anxious when he enters the room
He thinks he should properly introduce himself when he enters
[I&#39;m santa claus, stay right there].
Mashu: (its not wrong but, that just sounds like a robber breaking in.....)
Guda: whats important is a smile right?
Mashu agrees
but,she thinks the previous santas are kinda but not really good at that either
images of nightingale and salter appears in her mind <img class="emoji " alt="gudao" title="gudao" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/676422808653266947.png">
She thinks that the other servants are already used to it, and make it a goal to be better at (?, sorry for my shit tl guys <img class="emoji " alt="aokojoke" title="aokojoke" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/676084126134173697.png"> )
Karna says he&#39;ll try
He says he is not good at the job yet, but will accept any training to be better at it (or smth)
but guda thinks Karna santa is like a boxer
That reminds mashu of smth ash said earlier, and we go into flashback mode, complete with sound effect
Ash: oioioi! karna
Ash said he heard things have became interesting, and Karna says he doesn&#39;t think its interesting, but he have a role to carry out
Karna punches at ash after saying its nice ash is always genki
Ash remember the days he spend practicing  skills they learnt on the day and spar with each other
and Duryodhana got enough of it and walks away halfway though
Ash trains with Karna until he is content, and always get injured
Karna says he have no time to rest for getting better, and was grateful for those days
and it is the same now</span>

ash: .........?
guda: santa karna, what do you think?
a piece of motivation to improve who is stoic and serious, and always does unexpected things before you noticed
thats the karna during his training years
he even lied to brahmin and became a student of his father&#39;s master (? might be reading this wrong)
ash says if you ask karna, he&#39;ll say [I didn&#39;t lie, i just stayed quiet]
ash says that kinda stoic training if compared with modern style is like boxing style right?
guda: naruhodo
ash says his attitude towards others will also change a little , especially towards arjuna
then he says he doesn&#39;t know what will happen
he says some excise is good too and ash excuses himself and says he is going to the grab some food,
he says it feels like the old karna, who is practicing because he is performing a role he is not used to
reminds him of the time he is focused on training
ash leaves after saying no matter what happens its still karna
flashback ends, and mashu says there are alot of servants who&#39;s attitude changed after their saint graph is modified, and there is nothing to be surprised about anymore
karna moves to the next room
he have a....bike for the trainer (guda) ?
mashu: this is where the real training start, lets catch up sempai
guda: OK!
they reached the next room
guda is out of breath
he apparently didn&#39;t use the bike
mash gives guda some water, but karna refuses, saying it&#39;ll affect his.....err that thing abt not drinking when working out
and ask guda to drink his portion
he enters the room after repeating guda&#39;s advice of smile is important</span>

after some explanation from mashu
osakebe is shocked, and says he should stop entering a lady&#39;s room suddenly
osakebe says its refereshing to see a male santa
and for her present she wants errr, sensei&#39;s newest work, karna then says santa will grant her wishes
and take out a black present box
mashu is shocked that its black, cuz the boxes before this are all in christmas mood
osakebe can&#39;t open the box
karna ask her to hold then box
then we got...an animation....
SANTA PUNCH
osakebe is complaining that the stuffs inside will be gone too
box is still not open
but the wall is broken
nursery&#39;s present can&#39;t be opened either
she thinks santa became an old man that is bullying her
red hare smells his present and confirmed that it its the highest quality carrot
but even with lubu&#39;s strenght he can&#39;t open it
karna states that he is doing as trained, but doesn&#39;t understand why that kinda presents came out
there are normal presents, but sometimes those black ones appeared
mashu suggest that something sinister is going on (like which christmas doesn&#39;t have this)
she gathers people for a meeting

quetz samba: someone is interfering with santa power from afar
she says that its normally not possible
santa alter: because of that black presents appeared like bugs
karna: ....souka
nightingale santa: pollution of medical resource due to outside influence. i won&#39;t let it get away. we should deal with it quick
those presents that can&#39;t be open, da vinci suggest calling it black present for convinence
guda: do we know why it can&#39;t be open?
unbelievabally strong conceptual barrier is taking a minimum box shape
she feels like the box is under the influence of god authority level stuffs
da vinci says there is currently no way to open it
da vinci says given time they might be able to find a way to open them, but dunno how long that&#39;ll take
karna says that if this continues christmas will be over and he won&#39;t be able to finish his role
san(ta): hohoho, there is where plan b comes in
they follow the distruption of santa power and found the source

and following the source they confirmed it to one of them
karna: in short, the person behind this is over there
davinci: the possibility is high. seeing the shape of the singularity it must be not unrelated
mashu: did you say....shape?
da vinci says she&#39;ll understand once she sees the observation data
and the mini singularity appeared with a certain characteristic
and there is no way it has nothing to do with the black present incident. its a characteristic that&#39;ll make everyone think that way
this singularity itself is cut off
its inside a box, and completely shut off
blockaded singularity(閉塞特異点), shall we name it that?
davinci continues saying that it is a little different from the black presents in which they can observe the insides to a certain extend
davinci says that they can rayshift inside thoughguda: then we have no choice but to go take back the correct presents
karna is thankful
mashu is going too
the place is somewhere cold, and she reminds to not forget cold protection equipments
davinci says its a blockaded singularity thats different from the usual ones, and the number they can rayshift is lesser than usual
and so the other santas can&#39;t go
da vinci says there might be changes different from a usual singularity, and ask them to be careful
karna says that he won&#39;t drop his guard until he became a true santa. and says thats a useless and excess warning (sorry, bad tl)
??? (arjuna): (ku...you should have accepted that warning nicely.)
arjuna says that even though that man is now a santa, there seems to be some changes inside. it would be okay if it doesn&#39;t cause any trouble for master.....
arjuna says it&#39;ll be fine if he pretends he doesn&#39;t sees it, and says that christmas have nothing to do with him

a mashin of snake who brings drought that fought with indra countless time, in other words an evil dragon
vritra confirms that

but karna is like &quot;i can&#39;t tell myself its okay because of that&quot;
someone who can clear all obstacles to christmas by themselves is a true santa claus
me who can&#39;t do that is an incomplete santa who doesn&#39;t have enough skills
and still needs to improve
guda: what are we going to do now?
da vinci says they understood a few things
the fastest way is to find a way to defeat vritra, but there is also other methods
there are a few cores of the blockaded singularity left
*few blockaded singularity left
they form some sorta gate or pipeline that influences the presents, and if they can find them and destroy all of them
they can seal the route that is influencing the presents
but the only way they can track is to follow vritra herself
so they might meet vritra again
da vinci is considering the team to send, mainly thinking abt indra related servants and dragon slayers
hence the rate up servants this time
some unknown place, vritra
she is apparently enjoying herself
she tried taking away christmas present and no water for once
and baited someone delicious
she sense that apart from that man (karna), there are others that smells like indra
she is excited for tomorow

parvati: even though that goes without saying for you arjuna

stealing water from the world of humans, an evil dragon that brings drought to the lands and makes people suffer
the king of ma(furigana: asura) that was slayed by the gods multiple times, but always returns to cause evil
parvati says she understand that, but how should she put it, its christmas
and says she thinks she should stay put this time
arjuna: ........?
pavarti: a, but if you want to go i won&#39;t stop you, or rather i want you to solve this in my stead
it goes without saying one person is not enough
everyone needs to work together. you understand right?

parvati: yes. if vritra is going after the santa, protecting the person directly is the most efficient way right?

guda: cold! sakura (the tree) are frozen......
da vinci says that the environment has changed more than a regular singularity

in short they dont know what is going to happen, and should be prepared
guda: roger
santa: santa&#39;s season is normally cold. there is no problem. or rather this is a very christmas scenery
its a fitting environment for road work
and the tough part can train the mind
da vinci ask to not let guda suffer as much as they can
santa says road work is a santa&#39;s job, and won&#39;t put too much on guda
da vinci: next is to confirm the members
blockaded singularity&#39;s resource management is tough, so the rayshifted servants are limited
there is a maximum of 4 servants

and needs to deal with the environment
you guys who are [used to journeys] [good at protecting master] and [killed a dragon] are choosen

when he was alive he rode bayyard and travelled to various places with god&#39;s teaching
he also been a protective saint for juvenile&#39;s outdoors activities
mashu says she have travelled through various places during the restoration of human order, and that is all of her experinces
she is worried she does not have the ability to deal with unexpected troubles
and due to that, she is relieve georgios is there
georgios says he&#39;ll do his best to answer her trust
and says that when it comes to dragon, it is not an opponent to take lightly of
he says he is serious normally, but this time he&#39;ll be even more serious
he is apparently surpressing his urge to take photos of this frozen hell

even though there is no way she can&#39;t go against vritra will, vritra is thankful she obeyed so easily
???: obeying master&#39;s order, a shinobi is that kind of thing
but, even though she understand she is something like a copy (i think?) of the original, she still have one thing to say
this is stupid
vritra: what?
she says that thinking just because they recognize her they will let their guard down is native
and says that just because they have the same face doesn&#39;t mean they will go easy
vritra say she&#39;ll look forward to it
chiyome wonders why she even make the inside resembles the original if thats her plan is just to use the same face
vritra wants chiyome to dance for her, since she is wearing miko
chiyome: daga kotowaru
cuz its not a festival or worship related thing
all the servants are like super worried abt guda
and he got a little annoyed
ice spikes shoots at guda, but sigurd deflected them
apparently they are frozen sakura petals
got blown by winds
georgios says that this is likely a natural event in this singularity and ask the others to look out for it

chiyome came out
da vinci says she is a little different from the one in chaldea
a well made copy, and have characteristics simmiliar to a shadow servant
she made the copy by errr, using the karma she got from making karna her enemy, pretty much summons her cuz she have snake dna (?)
oh
she is the core
and vritra puts the data of chiyome inside it with her ma

vritra ask them to enjoy and teleports away
chiyome explains that she is not chiyome, but vritra&#39;s familiar with chiyome&#39;s personality slapped into it
guda says he won&#39;t go easy
and sigurd goes into super serious mode
which causes chiyome to complain, saying that she is just being used by vritra
cuz he is treating this as evil dragon slaying, but chiyome is just a snek
battle time
They beat chiyome, guda feels sorry fpr her and says he&#39;ll play with her once they reach chaldea
We got a fucking animation of the core breaking and the place become sakura heaven
Sigurd wants to bring bryn to watch the flowers someday, and georgios takes a picture to celebrate
Da vinci announce mission ends, as vritra is gone
Vritra in a dark place: this is more exciting that expected

the dragon slayer this time is martha
<img class="emoji " alt="aokojoke" title="aokojoke" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/676084126134173697.png"> georgios was like &quot;as fellow saints lets do our best to defeat the dragon&quot;
but martha is a little reserved about that
and tarasque be like: GuRuuu.....(ha, ha. When our eyes first meet I remembered thinking [ah, I&#39;m dead])
mashu is excited to see two dragon slaying saints working together
but err, boxer mode karna thought it was a competition, and marta is like &quot;this isn&#39;t a competition you know&quot;
karna: anyways, martha, you are an amazing sparring partner
my saint fist and your saint fist, which is faster and harder, i want to test it out (super deformed last part, cuz too complicated to tl for a joke kek)
but martha is like &quot;today I&#39;m just a saint!&quot;
yey, seems like you understand how embaressing your summer form is
martha: no, its not like I&#39;m not interested, but lets talk about that some place where master is not around
apparently she wants to shake away the weird image she have rn
so for now she is just a saint
she mentioned pollux, and says her fists are good, suggesting karna to find her
karna says he tried a few times, but castor always inturrupts
arjuna says not to take that half santa seriously
and focus back on the mission
they are walking on the beach rn
martha ask what kinda dragon vritra is
georgios says right now he can only see it as a human with a tail, and wonders abt the true form
santa karna: as expected size matters huh?
martha: well, thats the source of weight and power
georgios explains that even if the dragon have wings and can fly
they still need legs to support themselves</span>

and karna made some boxing reference i do not understand, somethign abt body flow?
arjuna was looking abit weird, so guda suggest rest, but he declined, saying they need to keep alert
then karna says he wasn&#39;t letting his guard down, and studying the opponent is important. and say they should study to become a good santa
arjuna agrees, saying they should study together so they can be a good san- wait what
^i&#39;m not making this up btw
arjuna: I have no intention of becoming a santa! whats with that surprised face!?
later (i think, given the special effect)
martha calls out to arjuna
martha ask him whats bothering him, and he can talk to her if she wants
arjuna says he is just confused, and ask what martha thinks about that santa karna
martha thinks he is different from usual
like meeting a childhood friend after a long time
arjuna says he can&#39;t denied that, as they had both studied and grew up together even though their standings are different
but says aside from that they have more going on
and because of that, he feels abit irritated towards that thing that is acting like he forgot all of that
martha&#39;s opinion is that karna is feeling nostalgic about the past
after that martha asks if she have done any good for the lost young man as a saint
but before arjuna can asnwer, the earth shakes

ice wave is coming from the sea
everyone except karna rides tarasque and escaped
karna do his own timing and jumped
georgios observed a second wave
karna sees this as rope jumping like training
afterwards
apparently the wave comes in periods
they think its a natural pheomenon like the frozen sakura petals from last night
it comes again
and tarasque dodged it again, but its tired
tarasque: GRRu, Gruuu...... (let me rest a little nee-chan)
but martha was like &quot;i didn&#39;t raise you to be that soft&quot;
da vinci spotted the source
it was......lambda
vritra is there too
martha&#39;s first impression is &quot;its not that big&quot;
apparently lambda is dancing on ice
and that was just warmup
we be dodging ice again
apparently she was spinning and stuffs and the ice she was stepping on go sawed off, thus creating the phenomenon
they finally noticed chaldea
vritra is not fighting this time either
apparently a special frozen stage was prepared and lambda was ask to just dance
guda: so yesterday&#39;s chiyome is today&#39;s lambda
mashu confrims by saying its a copy emulated by vritra (note that she used english emulate here)
lambda says that even though she is a copy, a star is a star
and that when she is dancing, she is the only beauty
and she starts her special show
but have one more thing to say before that
she points to martha
she asks if the thing she is sitting on related to leviathan
and martha says that tarasque is indeed leviathan&#39;s spawn
lambda says since she is based on leviathan, she feels smth special
martha ask if tarasque feels anything, but he says no
she says lambda is penguin motive, not leviathan
lambda: ha? no matter where you see it its clearly leviathan
(i don&#39;t know the true form but, anyways the me who is leviathan based feels nostalgic towards it, and the mana also instantiated it, so it must be leviathan......right?)</span>

georgios wanted to investigate furthur, but lambda ask him to shut up
and touching the cast is forbidden
lambda wants her &quot;son&quot; to join her program
she is thinking of a new program name
and martha hits her
saying tarasque is her......brother? (the yakuza kind)
they started some sorta cat fight
with tarasque in the middle
mashu is giving commentary
lambda says that since its leviathan&#39;s child, she should look after it
errr, idk how to tl this but, martha basicly insulted lambda by saying she is a native girl
ぽっと出の小娘
tarasque: nee-san nee-san! please wait a min, this, both side, i&#39;m squashed, ahhhhhh.......)
its coming out! my insides are coming out!
karna: this type of situation, i heard of it
its something unrelated to both santa and boxing, just information from the library
the case of two mothers from ikkyu
where each mom is pulling one of the childs hand, tearing him apart, but over here its the oppsite
where is child is squashed instead

now lambda is sorry she used her full strenght and hurt tarasque
apparently part of her plan to make the opponent hold back, as a star needs ellagence, not strenght
she starts to diss martha, but martha goes IGIARI
and says she belives in tarasque&#39;s toughness
and lambda didn&#39;t
and thats the difference between how much they trust tarasque
and thus its her victory
apparently georgios approves...kinda
tarasque is hurting kek
welp, now she wanna fight
battle time, brb
lambda goes into philisophy mode abt something star is like an illusion smth
and she&#39;ll do as the fans want, and shall retire now
tarasque: GuRruuu..... (sorry, but in the end I like rampaging more than dancing)
vritra finally speaks, saying nice dance
vritra wants to poof again, but karna stops her
he says he noticed smth
he wants her to answer a question
its abt her goal of distrupting christmas
karna says she didn&#39;t try to kill him directly, but did smth like sealing the boxes
and he thinks there is meaning in interupting the distribution of presents
karna: like the light weight skating boxer just now, you also have a present you want right?
or that she is angry at the fact she didn&#39;t get one
vritra says thats pretty much the case
karna asks what present she wants
and he&#39;ll do his best to find it in his bag
vritra says there is no need for that, for what she wants is to see them suffer from having christmas taken from them
what a ma like me seeks is smth like that

dark place again
vritra is asking someone to cooperate with her
she said smth abt making a chain with her ma
or smth\
and chapter ends with her saying smth abt not meeting is funner, and she&#39;ll watch from afar

As it is not just flames, but contains mass as well, getting hit is bad.</span>

From falla: 堰界竜 (いかいりゅう) ヴリトラ = Blockaded Realm Dragon Vritra is a manifestation of the Concept of Obstruction (障害, shougai). It is something that blockade the world. To the human world that is an obstruction as well as a trial. It is nothing more, and nothing less. Like in the myths, Vritra took the water multiple times and caused drought, and got killed by Indra. But that action is most likely not meant to cause the extinction of humanity. It brings suffering but, it will certainly be defeated by Indra, as if that&#39;s its fate.</span>
